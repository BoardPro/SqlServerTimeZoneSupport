Introduction:
First off, thank you for considering contributing to SQL Server Time Zone Support.  If you're passionate about Time zones, passionate about SQL Server, or you just want to make the SQL world a little better, you're in the right place.  

Following these guidelines helps to communicate that you respect the time of the developers managing and developing this open source project. In return, the maintainers will reciprocate that respect in addressing your issue, assessing changes, and helping you finalize your pull requests.

We're looking for and eagerly accepting all contributions.  Whether you want to improve performance or fix bugs, or improve documentation,  triage bugs, or write  tutorials, any contribution is welcome.  


Ground Rules
<To be added>

Your First Contribution

Unsure where to begin contributing? You can start by looking through these beginner and help-wanted issues: 
<to be added - some blurb about 
Beginner issues - issues which should only require a few lines of code, and a test or two.
Help wanted issues - issues which should be a bit more involved than beginner issues. 
Both issue lists are sorted by total number of comments. While not perfect, number of comments is a reasonable proxy for impact a given change will have
/TBA>

Working on your first Pull Request? You can learn how from this free series, How to Contribute to an Open Source Project on GitHub.

Getting started:
For something that is bigger than a one or two line fix:

- Create your own fork of the code
- Do the changes in your fork
- If you like the change and think the project could use it, just send a pull request!

Small contributions such as fixing spelling errors, where the content is small enough to not be considered intellectual property, can be submitted by a contributor directly.

As a rule of thumb, changes are obvious fixes if they do not introduce any new functionality or creative thinking. As long as the change does not affect functionality, some likely examples include the following:

Spelling / grammar fixes
Typo correction, white space and formatting changes
Comment clean up
Bug fixes that change default return values or error codes stored in constants
Adding logging messages or debugging output
Changes to ‘metadata’ files like Gemfile, .gitignore, build scripts, etc.
Moving source files from one directory or package to another

How to report a bug
If you find a security vulnerability, do NOT open an issue. Email mj1856 instead. In order to determine whether you are dealing with a security issue, ask yourself these two questions:

Can I access something that's not mine, or something I shouldn't have access to?
Can I disable something for other people?
If the answer to either of those two questions are "yes", then you're probably dealing with a security issue. Note that even if you answer "no" to both questions, you may still be dealing with a security issue, so if you're unsure, just contact us directly.  


When filing an issue, make sure to answer these questions:

What "IDE" are you using (Visual Studio 2015  with SSDT, SSMS directly, notepad++, etc)? (if applicable)
What SQL Server version are you using (both management tools  / client and SQL Engine)? (if applicable)
What operating system and processor architecture are you using?
What did you do?
What did you expect to see?
What did you see instead?

How to suggest a feature or enhancement
As noted in the introduction, SQL Server 2016 includes built-in support for Windows time zones using a new AT TIME ZONE syntax. If you only need support for Windows time zones (not IANA time zones), consider using this feature instead of this project. Read the news here, and documentation here. <content to be added>

Code review process
Explain how a contribution gets accepted after it’s been submitted.
Who reviews it? Who needs to sign off before it’s accepted? When should a contributor expect to hear from you? How can contributors get commit access, if at all?

The core team (basically Matt) looks at Pull Requests on a best effort basis. We seek to get better, and are looking for volunteers to co-maintain the library to increase the cadence.
